# The implementation of Graph in C++ on platform VS2013.

This project includes the implementation of graph by linked list(GraphByList.cpp) and the corresponding algorithm(AlgorithmInGraph). There are also some exercises based on the idea of graph theory(mainly about dfs and bfs) in maze.cpp and Graph_exercise.cpp.
